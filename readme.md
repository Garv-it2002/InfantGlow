# InfantGlow

**InfantGlow** is a health-tech project aimed at improving maternal and infant healthcare in regions where women face cultural, social, or economic barriers to openly discussing their health and seeking medical assistance. The project uses data-driven insights and predictive analytics to provide actionable recommendations for better maternal and child care, helping identify risks and offering timely interventions.

## Features

## Social Impact

In many societies, women often face barriers in accessing healthcare, either due to cultural norms, societal restrictions, or a lack of privacy. These barriers can prevent women from freely discussing their health concerns, leading to delayed or missed opportunities for proper care. InfantGlow seeks to break down these barriers by:

- **Providing anonymous healthcare insights**: In societies where women may be restricted from openly discussing their health, InfantGlow allows for private, data-driven analysis of maternal and infant health, which can be crucial in identifying issues without fear of social stigma.
  
- **Empowering women in restricted environments**: In areas where seeking medical help is stigmatized, the project helps women access vital health information and make informed decisions without needing to visit a doctor physically, allowing for timely intervention when necessary.
  
- **Improving access to healthcare**: By providing a digital solution, InfantGlow enables remote monitoring of maternal and infant health, thus helping bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility for women in underserved areas.

- **Reducing infant and maternal mortality**: The predictive models in InfantGlow help identify high-risk pregnancies and early signs of infant health issues, allowing for preventive measures that can significantly reduce mortality rates, especially in regions where timely medical intervention is not easily accessible.

InfantGlowâ€™s goal is to make healthcare more accessible, empowering women to take charge of their health and well-being, even in environments where traditional healthcare access is limited.
